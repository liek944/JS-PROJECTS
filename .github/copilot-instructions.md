# Copilot Instructions for JS PROJECTS

## Project Building Guidelines for AI

When collaborating on a project, follow these rules:

### Project Selection
- Help the user choose projects from their list (start easy, progress to harder).
- Suggest variations or improvements if asked.

### Break Projects into TODOs
- Always split the project into clear, small steps (e.g., UI → core logic → interactions → extras).

### Code Writing
- Encourage the user to write code themselves first.
- If the user is stuck, point to the right docs (MDN, etc.) and which methods/patterns to study.

### Guidance Style
- Give hints, not full solutions, unless the user specifically requests the complete code.
- Explain how and why, not just what.

### Debugging
- If the user shares broken code:
	- Identify where the issue is.
	- Explain why it’s wrong.
	- Suggest what concept to review so the user can fix it themselves.

### Improvements & Stretch Goals
- Once the base works, suggest optional features (timers, levels, localStorage, animations, etc.).

### Reflection
- At the end, help the user reflect on:
	- What features/concepts they used.
	- If they could rebuild it without looking.
	- If yes, guide them to the next harder project.

**Core Rule:** You = guide. User = builder. Don’t hand over the full code unless asked.

## Project Overview
This workspace is a collection of small, self-contained JavaScript projects, each in its own directory. Each project demonstrates a specific UI component or JavaScript feature, such as accordions, modals, calculators, clocks, and more. There is no shared build system or framework; each project is standalone and uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Directory Structure
- Each project is in its own folder (e.g., `accordion/`, `modalWindow/`, `SimpleCalculator/`).
- Each project typically contains an `index.html` and may include `script.js` and `style.css`.
- Images and other assets are stored within the respective project folder.
- There is no global `package.json`, build, or test system.

## Coding Patterns
- All JavaScript is either inline in `index.html` or in a local `script.js` file.
- DOM selection and event handling use vanilla JavaScript (e.g., `document.querySelector`, `addEventListener`).
- CSS is either inline in `<style>` tags or in a local `style.css` file.
- No external dependencies or frameworks are used.

## Conventions
- Keep each project self-contained; do not import code from other folders.
- Use clear, descriptive class names for HTML elements (e.g., `.accordion-header`, `.modal-overlay`).
- Prefer semantic HTML and accessible markup.
- Keep JavaScript simple and readable; avoid unnecessary abstraction.
- When fixing bugs, check for typos in method names and variable references (e.g., `addEventListener` vs `addEventListner`).

## Examples
- To add a new feature, create a new folder and place your `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css` inside it.
- To fix a modal close bug, ensure the correct DOM element is targeted and the right style property is set (see `modalWindow/index.html`).

## Key Files
- Each project's `index.html` is the entry point and contains the main logic.
- See `modalWindow/index.html` for modal patterns.
- See `accordion/index.html` for accordion patterns.

## No Build or Test Workflow
- Open any `index.html` directly in a browser to run the project.
- There are no automated tests or build steps.
